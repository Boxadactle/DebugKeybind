Debug keybind is a mod that allows you to rebind the (previously) hard-coded F3 menu and all of it's actions. 

Didn't like **F3+Q**? You can easily rebind it as if it was a normal keybind. 
Don't like **F3+G**? It can be rebound in the exact same way.

**Just open the debug keybinds menu, and you'll be on your way!**

## ðŸ‘¤ How do I open the Debug Keybinds menu?
Opening the menu is super simple. You can open it from your modloader's Config Screen, but it can also be opened with a conveniently placed button placed next to the normal keybinds button!
